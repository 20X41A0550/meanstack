<p>Browse Chrome as a guest<br>
    In Guest mode, you won't see or change any other Chrome profile's info. When you exit Guest mode, your browsing activity is deleted from the computer.<br>
    
    Guest mode is ideal for:
    
    Letting others borrow your computer, or borrowing someone elseâ€™s computer.<br>
    Using a public computer, like one at a library or cafe.<br>
    If you want to browse privately on your own computer, use Incognito mode. You'll see your info and settings without saving any browsing history.<br></p>
